# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography in C

A lightweight steganography tool written in C that hides and extracts secret messages in BMP image files using **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** manipulation.

---

## 📦 Features

- Encode secret text messages into `.bmp` images
- Decode hidden messages from `.bmp` images
- Works with 24-bit BMP files
- Simple command-line interface
- Pure C implementation

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program modifies the **least significant bit (LSB)** of each byte in the pixel data of a BMP file to encode each bit of the secret message. The message is null-terminated (`\0`) during embedding to identify the end of the message during decoding.
